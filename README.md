# MathParser
### String Parser for Math Statements

#### This project is open-source and free for reuse and re-distribution.

This project is an archive of some old code I wrote years ago for parsing functions, doing arithmetic, etc. I've cleaned it up and added some unit tests. I've also written a simple command line interface.
